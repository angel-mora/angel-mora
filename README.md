Some things about me:

- 🔭 I started up an Open Source project on my own GitHub organization, to create templates for both Ruby on Rails and Python Django to handle Geographic Information Systems with the latest React-based visualization tools like Kepler.gl.
- I created a Nutrition Application with an incredible Business Professor from Anahuac University. It's called Baos and will be available in the public domain very soon!
- 🌱 I’m learning Math foundations to improve my understanding of complex Data Structures and Algorithms.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Ruby on Rails based projects that require a User Interface design. Flows with Figma and React are a nice to have. If it involves libraries like Reveal.js, Leaflet.js or Kepler.gl for the front end, that would be triple awesome!!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with *emacs* org-mode based Zettelkasten research. I know a lot of people who is doing great work at it and would like to connect these workflows with Pinboard (best bookmarking service of the world) API. Would also love a hand to help me with Sigma.js or D3.js, they are both awesome to me!
- 💬 Ask me about Editorial Automation, I am an Open Source librarian by heart.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email!
- 😄 Fun fact: I wanted to be a singer but I play guitar better than singing, ouch!
